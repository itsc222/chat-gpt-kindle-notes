However, foreign language teaching (mainly referring to English language teaching) in China has been criticized for manufacturing students with deaf and dumb English, or students who are highly competent in English reading and writing but poor in listening and speaking.(e.g. , Tsui, 2007; Cheng and Wang, 2012)

Everyone performs multiple identities according to one’s understanding as a sense of self in various social roles and contexts (Holzman, 2009; Yuan and Zhang, 2020; Bao et al. , 2021).Therefore, the “self ” is one of the most heavily researched constructs in psychology, and the study of self has extended beyond psychological domains to attract attention from anthropologists, sociologists and, more recently, over the past 20 years, educational researchers and applied linguists

The discursive self is constructed through interaction with multiple social discourses and forces (Miller Marsh, 2002; Beauchamp and Thomas, 2009). Discursive selves characterize the way teachers speak and talk as well as how they act and react in particular social situations

While feeling confdent about her own position, Sunny was surrounded by a number of disabling discourses which drew her away from teaching communicatively. The story of Sunny making compromises to accommodate students’ learning habits with respect to vocabulary was a case in point

When the autobiographical selves are FIGURE 2 | The three selves: a holistic interactional model. met with teaching contexts which contain an array of variables, such as students, the curriculum and the institutional context, teachers are faced with a heteroglossia, simultaneously entering into a dialogic space requiring them to negotiate with each of the variables

This qualitative study draws on Bakhtin’s concepts of dialogism, answerability, and addressivity to discuss how English language teachers negotiated the shifting and confictive context to construct selves in relation to the promoted communicative language teaching approach

Changes in purpose, context, and participant role which are common in social interaction may result in variability of identities. In other words, identity, being a product and a process simultaneously, is socially developed, interpreted, and adjusted according to shifts in the context (Tsui, 2007; Nagatomo, 2012; Zhang and Ben Said, 2014; Song, 2016; Yuan and Zhang, 2020)

Conceptualizing the CE teacher’s mind as a polyphony containing multiple discourses and voices competing for supremacy, we observed that teacher self is multifaceted, and three layers of self, that is the autobiographical self, the discursive self, and the pedagogical self

(E-INT-1-46).Teachers’ awareness of such infuences and their ways of responding to them constitute the formation of a teacher identity, and it has been found from the fve teachers’ stories that teachers’ metacognition and positioning strategies varied signifcantly when facing such a heteroglossia. Tony and Nancy revealed themselves as advocates for the communicative teaching approach, and they consistently positioned

Teachers’ awareness of such infuences and their ways of responding to them constitute the formation of a teacher identity, and it has been found from the fve teachers’ stories that teachers’ metacognition and positioning strategies varied signifcantly when facing such a heteroglossia

The pedagogical self is the way by which teachers defne their space of teaching and pedagogy in their own terms as answerability and establish authorship within their social contexts. The development of the pedagogical self is a dialogic and creative process of analyzing a context and interpreting it with our own words, or active responsive understanding (Bakhtin, 1981), and the self is viewed as self-defning entity fused with the possibility of authorship (Holquist, 2002; Vitanova, 2010)

Identifying and understanding conficts, competing voices, and sites of tension in their stories is critical to addressing the curricular challenges teachers face today (Kayi-Aydar, 2015; Aoyama, 2021; Jiang and Zhang, 2021)

While acknowledging the diverse ways of conceptualizing identity and self, we defne the teacher identity/self in light of the post-structural view as multiple presentations of self that are exhibited through actions and emotions within various social contexts (Kayi-Aydar, 2015; Zhang and Zhang, 2020)

Hamachek (1999) poignantly highlights the importance of the identity issue in teaching by saying, “consciously, we teach what we know; unconsciously we teach who we are (p.209).

Authoritative discourse is discourse that is enshrined and established. Bakhtin describes it as “religious, political, moral; the word of a father, of adults and of teachers” (1981, p.342). It is discourse whose “authority was already acknowledged in the past,” “a prior discourse” (1981, p.342)

The making of a self, or ideological becoming, unfolds through the transformation of authoritative discourse into internally persuasive discourse.

The autobiographical self acknowledges that teachers came to teaching with their own personal histories which provided the base for developing beliefs and conceptions of ELT

The discursive selves are therefore constructed through negotiating and renegotiating with these variable discourses

Based on Bakhtin’s dialogism and the case study fndings, we bring cognition, identity and practice together and conceptualize the teacher self as having multiple facets and layers: the autobiographical self, the discursive self, and the pedagogical self

The heteroglossia, a dynamic interaction of discourses in the world, creates a polyphony in the mind, out of which the identity is made. As discourses compete for acceptance and prominence, he suggests that it is through these ideological battles that individual identities are formed.

He uses the term ideological becoming to describe this identitymaking process

This study seeks to fll in this gap by exploring in what ways Bakhtin’s theories of dialogism can be drawn on to understand the dynamic, ongoing process of identity construction of teachers in a discourse-rich reform context

Rather, teachers as creative Bakhtinian subjects are capable of authoring their own consciousness, utterances, and acts through dialogic activities

Opponents claim that CLT is not applicable to the Chinese context due to a number of constraints, such as students’ minimal opportunity to use English in real life, large class size, heavy workloads, limited resources, and strong orientations toward exams, all of which pose serious challenges for the teachers to make CLT a reality at the classroom level (Butler, 2011; Liu, 2015)

This heteroglossia of language pedagogy places the great majority of Chinese English teachers at the nexus of competing discourses in a postmethod condition (Kumaravadivelu, 2006) with the emergence of a variety of new localized approaches (cf.Wen, 2017; Han, 2018; Zhang and Wang, 2018)

The rich data support a Bakhtinian understanding that teachers are active users and producers of theory, in their own right (Johnson, 2006)

In contrast, internally persuasive discourse is authoritative discourse that has been explored, questioned, and made one’s own.Thus, internally persuasive discourse is a hybrid discourse, consisting of language that is “half-ours and half-someone else’s” (Bakhtin, 1981, p.345)

In a similar vein, Menard-Warwick (2011) drew on the concept of heteroglossia to examine Chilean EFL teachers’ engagement with English popular culture (music, video, and the Internet) and how popular culture infuenced their decisions on becoming EFL teachers and pedagogy

Answerability and Addressivity Bakhtin (1986) contends that people living in the world are compelled to respond. The state of being and existing is “a state of being addressed and a process of answering” (Holland and Lachicotte, 2007, p.169).

Hence, to live means keeping on forming responses to the world (Holquist, 1990)

Including Nancy, three teachers were found to be actively engaged in dialogizing with their prior learning experiences through which new meanings were negotiated and generated

Teachers were actively engaged in the dialog with their prior learning experiences in the form of what Bakhtin called “internal speech” (Bakhtin, 1984, p.238)

In other words, the subject is constantly impelled by the power and authority of its circumstances, while authoring self to respond (Holquist, 2002

A teacher’s articulated teaching philosophy, pedagogical choice, and relationship with students and others are embodiments of the discursive self

The three selves constitute the whole language teacher identity that is taking form gradually through chronotopic construction, a synchronized performance of multiple historicities (Blommaert and De Fina, 2016), and is future-oriented, unfnalizable, dynamic and open to change across time, and space

A holistic view of teachers’ cognition, practice and identities, drawing on Bakhtin’s notions of dialogism, answerability, heteroglossia, authoritative discourse, and internally persuasive discourse, highlights teachers’ subjectivities and agency

, teachers as creative Bakhtinian subjects are capable of authoring their own consciousness, utterances, and acts through dialogic activities.

In Bakhtin’s view, one-sidedness, or being monologic, leads to stagnation and dying out.Instead, the dialogic interaction or double-voicedness implies a two-sided meaning exchange
